//if statement

//if statement only executes when condition is true.
//syntax for 'if'  statement is 

//Syntax
if (condition){
  // code block to be executed
}

//if can work any where before else

//if-else statement
//this statement executes when upper statement is false and condition is true

//Syntax
else if (){
  // code block to be executed
}
//Note:else-if only works where it is after if statement or other els-if
//wrong:
//else if(){
  //code
//}

//if(){

//}

//right:
//if(){

//}

//else if (){

//}

//else-if vs if, if you write many if in line then compiler will check all whether it is true or false
//but when if is written first and else-if is written the compiler will check if,if condition is true it will not check others but condition if false it will check
//else-if till condition is true

//else statement
//this statement executes when all upper stements are false

//Syntax
else{
   // code block to be executed
}
